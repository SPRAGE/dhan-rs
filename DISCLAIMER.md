# ⚠️ Disclaimer

## AI-Generated Code

**This entire crate (`dhan-rs`) was generated by AI** (GitHub Copilot / Claude).
Every line of source code — including types, API implementations, WebSocket
parsers, error handling, and documentation — was produced by a large language
model.

## Not Tested in Production

While this library:

- ✅ Compiles successfully with `cargo check` and `cargo build`
- ✅ Follows the [DhanHQ API v2 specification](https://dhanhq.co/docs/v2/)
- ✅ Uses strongly-typed Rust structs with proper serde serialization

It has **NOT** been:

- ❌ Extensively tested against the live DhanHQ API
- ❌ Validated for correctness of order placement, modification, or cancellation
- ❌ Verified for accurate binary WebSocket market feed parsing with real data
- ❌ Audited for edge cases, race conditions, or failure modes
- ❌ Reviewed by DhanHQ or any financial technology professional

## Financial Risk Warning

**Trading in financial markets involves substantial risk of loss.** Using
unverified software for automated trading amplifies this risk significantly.

Before using this library with real money or in any production environment:

1. **Review the source code** — Read every file and understand what it does
2. **Write comprehensive tests** — Unit tests, integration tests against the
   sandbox API, and end-to-end tests
3. **Validate all order flows** — Place, modify, and cancel orders in a test
   environment before going live
4. **Verify market data** — Compare WebSocket feed output against known-good
   data sources
5. **Implement safeguards** — Rate limiting, position limits, circuit breakers,
   and monitoring
6. **Start small** — Begin with minimal positions and scale up only after
   thorough validation

## Recommendation

If you need a production-ready trading client:

1. Use [DhanHQ's official Python SDK](https://github.com/dhan-oss/DhanHQ-py)
   which is maintained and tested by DhanHQ
2. Or build your own client with proper testing and validation
3. Consider this library as a **starting point** or **reference implementation**,
   not a production-ready solution
